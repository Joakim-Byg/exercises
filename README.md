# Welcome to the Container Management Exercise Sessions
Welcome to your hands-on journey into Docker and container management! These exercise sessions are designed to give you 
practical experience with the fundamental commands and concepts. Our main objective is to get familiarity with a set of
essential operations commonly used when developing, operating and maintaining containers and hopefully preparing you to
leverage this technology in your daily work.

You'll be working through a series of exercises, each focusing on a key aspect of container management. 
Get ready to dive in and learn by doing!

## Your Exercise Journey: A Quick Overview
Here's a brief introduction to what you'll be covering in each section:

### Exercise 1: Getting Started - Running Your First Container
This initial exercise will help you confirm your container runtime (i.e. your Docker installation) is working correctly 
and introduce you to the very first command you'll use: `docker run`. It's your basic "hello world" moment in the 
containerized universe.

### Exercise 2: Managing Running Containers
Once you can run a container, you'll need to manage it. This section focuses on launching containers in the background,
listing them to see their status, and inspecting their logs to understand what's happening inside.

### Exercise 3: Stopping and Removing Containers
Containers have a lifecycle. Here, you'll learn how to gracefully stop containers that are no longer needed and how to
permanently remove them, ensuring a clean Docker environment.

### Exercise 4: Managing Docker Images
Images are the blueprints for your containers. This exercise will teach you how to pull pre-built images from Docker Hub
and manage the images stored on your local machine.

### Exercise 5: Port Mapping - Making Container Services Accessible
Containers often run services that need to be accessed from outside. This section will show you how to "map" ports,
allowing external traffic to reach services running inside your containers.

### Exercise 6: Volumes - Dynamic Configuration and Observation
Volumes provide a way to manage external data for your containers. In this exercise, you'll explore how volumes  can be
used to inject configuration files and dynamic content (input) into a running container. You will also learn to extract
logs or other generated data (output), allowing you to observe and control containerized services dynamically, while
also understanding how applications within containers react to these external changes.

### Exercise 7: Building Custom Images with Dockerfile (Introduction)
Ready to create your own containerized applications? This exercise provides an introduction to Dockerfiles, the simple
text files that contain instructions for building your very own custom Docker images.

### Exercise 8: Introduction to Docker Compose (Optional/Simple)
For applications with multiple services (like a web server and a database), Docker Compose simplifies management. This 
optional exercise provides a basic overview of how to define and run multi-container applications with a single command.

You are encouraged to experiment, ask questions, and explore beyond the exercises. The best way to learn is by doing! 
Good luck, and enjoy your containerized journey!
